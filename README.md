# Aim  
To understand and implement the different types of operators in C++.  

# Software Required  
Visual Studio  

# Theory  
An operator is a symbol that instructs the compiler to carry out specific mathematical or logical actions. C++ provides a wide range of built-in operators, categorized as follows:  

1. Arithmetic Operators  
2. Relational Operators  
3. Logical Operators  
4. Bitwise Operators  
5. Assignment Operators  

### 1. Arithmetic Operators  
These are the most commonly used operators in C++. They perform fundamental mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. Arithmetic operators are essential for performing calculations and processing data within programs.

### 2. Relational Operators  
Relational operators compare two values or expressions. The result of such a comparison is a boolean value â€” `true` if the condition holds, otherwise `false`. These operators play an important role in decision-making and conditional execution.

### 3. Logical Operators  
Logical operators are used when working with boolean values (`true` or `false`). They are crucial for combining multiple conditions and controlling program flow. There are three basic logical operators in C++: AND, OR, and NOT.

### 4. Bitwise Operators  
Bitwise operators perform operations directly on the binary representation of integers. These are widely used in low-level programming, cryptography, and performance-critical tasks where manipulation of individual bits is required.  

### 5. Assignment Operators  
Assignment operators allow variables to be initialized or updated with values. They are used not only to assign values but also to perform compound operations like `+=` or `-=`.

# Implementation  
In this practical, I demonstrated the use of different operators through the following examples:  

1. **Positive or Negative Number Check**  
   Utilizes comparison operators to identify whether a number is positive or negative.  

2. **Student Grade Evaluation**  
   Combines comparison and logical operators to assign grades based on the average marks obtained in five subjects.  

3. **Quadrant Identification**  
   Applies a mix of comparison and logical operators to determine the quadrant of a point given its coordinates.  

# Conclusion  
Through this exercise, I explored different categories of operators in C++ and gained a better understanding of how they are applied in various programming scenarios.
